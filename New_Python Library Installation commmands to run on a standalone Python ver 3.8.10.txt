Check python version 3.8.10 version is installed in PC
If it is already installed, first find where python is installed (to find this directory, look for python.exe where it is installed – as shown below)

C:\> Dir /s python.exe
c:\users\admin\appdata\local\programs\python\python38\python.exe
e.g c:\users\admin\appdata\local\programs\python\python38
Python 64 bit 3.8.10 with 8.6.9 build is installed

2. go to dos prompt ( from any directory e.g default typing CMD command on windows)
Go to prompt of 
c:\users\admin\appdata\local\programs\python\python38\scripts>

3. pip install numpy  ( It may say pip not installed if not installed)

4. First find where python is installed ( to find this directory, look for python.exe where it is installed – as shown below)
c:\users\admin\appdata\local\programs\python\python38\python.exe

5. see that the scripts directory is inside above directory

6. now execute pip install numpy from scripts directory
-- this command may not work  if  “pip”  is not installed
- or if numpy already exists , it will give a message 'requirement already satified"
( Suppose incase pip is not there , how to install pip first 
python get-pip.py

7. pip --version gave pip 21.1.1
To install latest version of pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
( This installed newest pip ver 23.3.1) 

8. pip install matplotlib (installed ver matplotlib 3.7.3)

9. for statsmodels installation
(This is required for MA, simple exponential model, AR, ARMA, ARIMA) 
pip install statsmodels ( this will take some time to install)

10. Now pip install tensorflow ( this may  also be installed)
	( This is required for LSTM, RNN, PID)

11. pip install keras ( This is required for LSTM, RNN, PID) 

12. pip install pandas

13. pip install time-python (required for LSTM, RNN, PID)

14. pip install scikit-learn (required for LSTM, RNN, PID)

15. pip install tclab (required for LSTM, RNN, PID)

16. pip install tqdm (required for LSTM, RNN, PID)

17. pip install tk / pip install tkinter (required for LSTM, RNN, PID)
