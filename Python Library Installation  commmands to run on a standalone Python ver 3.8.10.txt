Check python version 3.8.10  version is installed in PC
If it is already installed, first find where python is installed ( to find this directory, look for python.exe where it is installed – as shown below)
C:\> Dir /s python.exe
c:\users\admin\appdata\local\programs\python\python38\python.exe
e.g c:\users\admin\appdata\local\programs\python\python38
Python 64 bit 3.8.10 with 8.6.9 build is installed
2. go to dos prompt ( from any directory e.g default typing CMD command on windows)
Go to prompt of 
c:\users\admin\appdata\local\programs\python\python38\scripts>
3. pip install numpy  ( It may say pip not installed if not installed)
4. First find where python is installed ( to find this directory, look for python.exe where it is installed – as shown below)
c:\users\admin\appdata\local\programs\python\python38\python.exe
5. see that the scripts directory is inside above directory
6. now execute pip install numpy from scripts directory
-- this command may not work  if  “pip”  is not installed
- or if numpy already exists , it will give a message 'requirement already satified"
( Suppose incase pip is not there , how to install pip first 
python get-pip.py
7. pip --version gave pip 21.1.1
To install latest version of pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
( This installed newest pip ver 23.3.1) 
8. pip install matplotlib (installed ver matplotlib 3.7.3)
9. now pip install tensorflow ( this may  also be installed)
10. pip install keras ( This has already installed version 2.13.1)
see below : for statsmodels installation
( This is required for MA as  well as simple exponential model) 
Pip install statsmodels ( this will take some time to install)
